The game takes you through three totally different worlds: city streets, dusty desert highways, and icy snow roads. Each world has its own set of unique challenges and up to nine action-filled races. Whether you're dodging buses or flying past cars with nitro, it's all about quick reflexes and smart moves on just five keys on your keyboard.",

And please, please believe us, one second you're tapping your mouse, thinking this is just another mid clicker game.
